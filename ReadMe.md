1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system that you download onto your computer. 
It is essential that you use Git if you want to collaborate with other developers on a coding project or work on your own project.
In order to check if you already have Git installed on your computer you can type the command git --version in the terminal.

2. What is Github?
GitHub is a product that allows you to host your Git projects on a remote server somewhere (or in other words, in the cloud).
It's important to remember that GitHub is not Git. GitHub is just a hosting service. 
There are other companies who offer hosting services that do the same thing as GitHub, such as Bitbucket and GitLab.
